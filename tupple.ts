// let's study tuple in typescript
// tuple is a collection of values of different types
// tuple is similar to array but it has fixed length and each element has a specific type in specific order
// let' study with the example
let student:[string,number,boolean]=["sumit",5492,true];
console.log(student); // output: ["sumit", 5492, true]
// but if you change the order then you will get error 
// for example [5492,"sumit",true];
